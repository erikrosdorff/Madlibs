# Madlibs
This is a program that allows you to fill in a madlib using Python. It uses the 'f' input method in a string that allows different varibles to be placed into different locations
of the strings. 

Simply run the code and enter what is in the prompt.

Note:
Some grammar terms will be asked, as a small reminder:

1) Second form of the verb is simply past tense form 
e.g. Run -> Ran 
     See -> Saw
     Fly -> Flew
 
2) The base form of the verb is the infinitive without the word 'to'
e.g. to eat -> eat
     to type -> type
     to swim -> swim
